goChem is a library fro Computational Chemistry and Biochemistry
written in the Go programming language. 

Check out www.gochem.org for more information.


goChem uses either a zero-runtime-dependency, pure go 
implementation for the matrix operations, based in go.matrix 
(https://github.com/skelterjohn/go.matrix) Or a more efficient, 
cBlas based library (https://github.com/gonum/matrix)

Ramachandran plots require the Plotinum 
(http://code.google.com/p/plotinum/) library.

Reading xtc files require the xdrfile
library from Gromacs (www.gromacs.org) 


All dependencies of goChem are open source.


Design goals:

*Simplicity (of the code).
*Readability.
*Fast and light
*Concurrent when possible and necessary
*Easy to extend
*Useful for Computational Chemistry/Biochemistry 
at a classical and QM levels.




Current capabilities.

1.  Reads/writes PDB and XYZ files.

2.   Reads XTC and DCD files, both sequentially and concurrently.

3.  Superimposes molecules (especially adequate for non-proteins since  
	doesn't use sequence information). The user specify what 
	atoms to use for the superimposing transformation calculation. 
	Then all the atoms will be superimposed accordingly. This means that
	non-identical molecules can be superimposed.

4.   Calculates RMSD between sets of coordinates.

5.   Allows to select atoms and coordinates by using a go slice 
     of indexes.

6.   Allows to replace selected coordinates for a new set.

7.   Calculates moment tensor and elipsoid of inertia--related properties 

8.   The Molecule object implements the sort.Interface interface, 
     so atoms can easily be sorted by b-factors.

9.   Axis manipulation:
	 + Align a vector with the Z axis
	 + Rotate around the Z axis until the xy projection of a vector becomes 
	  the Y axis
	 + Rotate a sub-group of atoms in a molecule using any 2 coordinates as
      the rotation axis.

	 **The latter is implemented using Clifford algebra and, as a 
	 legacy version, Euler angles and rotation matrices (math for the 
	 Cliffor algebra implementation by Doc. Dr. Janne Pesonen). 
	 The Clifford algebra implementation is concurrent. In general, 
	 Clifford algebra is mathematically better behaving than Euler 
	 angles, which are not defined for certain rotations.*

10.  Calculates and draws Ramachandran plots (uses the Plotinum library).
        for an aminoacidic chain or a subset of it.

11.  Generates input for, run and recover results from QM calculations
	 with Turbomole, Orca and MOPAC (which must be obtained independently 
	 from their respective distributors.)

12.	Implements a JSON interface that allows easy communication of goChem
	programs with the PyMOL visualization program (www.pymol.org)


NOTE ON THE API:

On 13/11/2013 the API has been made stable. This means that only 
backward-compatible changes to the current API will be made 
to it for a year.
In the unlikely event that a serious problem requiring a minor API 
change would arise, Tools to automatically upgrade code will be made 
available.
